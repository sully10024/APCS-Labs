// Answers to Questions:
// 2. There was no error message because BlueJ automatically changes the name of the file when you
//      change the name of the class in the editor. Thanks, BlueJ.
// 3. There is no error when you change the text that you want the program to print, because it
//      prints whatever you put into the quotation marks. It just now prints "Helo World!"
// 4. When I remove the ending quotation mark from the "Hello, World!", the error that is returned is
//      that I have an "unclosed string literal." This makes sense for the type of error that it is.
// 5. When I remove the first quotation mark from it, I get " ')' expected " as the error message.
//      This is probably because the computer does not know that I am trying to print a string, and
//      instead of looking for a quotation mark, it is looking for a ")," and since there was a quotation
//      mark there instead, I got an error.
// 6. When removing the semicolon, the error report tells me that there was a semicolon expected, but it
//      wasn't there. Pretty straight forward.
