// Answers to Questions:
// 1. Not a legal identifier. It is therefore not a good one for this program.
//      Illegal identifiers are never good identifiers. It also uses reserved Java terms. (LEGAL, doesn't follow //etiquette)
// 2. SimpleProgram is a legal identifier, and is a good identifier because both of the words
//      are capitalized properly according to "Java Etiquette."
// 3. 1Simple is not a legal identifier. It starts with a number. Therefore, it is not a good identifier
//      to use.
// 4. _Simple_ is a legal identifier, however, it should not be used because it does not look nice, and it
//      does not follow Java Etiquette. Names of classes, in my opinion, should not not
//      start with underscores.
// 5. *Simple* is an illegal identifier, therefore, it does not work for us in any situation.
// 6. $123_45 is a legal identifier, but should not be used as a class name because it doesn't look nice.
// 7. Simple! is not a legal identifier, and therefore should not be used.
